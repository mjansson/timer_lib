 0.1  (2011-03-15)  Initial release
 0.2  (2011-03-20)  Removed timer type (always high precision)
                    Fixed timer_ticks_per_second declaration
                    Added test application
 0.3  (2011-03-22)  Removed unused error checks in POSIX code
                    Made timeGetTime fallback optional in Windows code (define USE_FALLBACK to 1)
                    Fixed check of QPC weirdness (signed issue)
 0.4  (2011-03-23)  timer_lib_initialize() returns non-zero if failed (no high precision timer available)
                    Changed POSIX path to use CLOCK_MONOTONIC
                    POSIX timer_system use CLOCK_REALTIME for actual timestamp
                    Addded Mach-O path for MacOS X
                    Changed POSIX path to use nanosecond frequency as returned by clock_gettime
 0.5  (2012-10-01)  Merged (cleaned up) MacOSX build fixes from Nicolas Léveillé
 0.6  (2013-01-11)  Simplified API, only using tick_t type as timestamp and removing custom timer struct
                    Removed old legacy fallback code for Windows platform
 0.7  (2013-01-11)  Using platform_lib for platform and compiler abstraction
 0.8  (2013-07-30)  Made library standalone with no deps (not using deprecated platform_lib)
